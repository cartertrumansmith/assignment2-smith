## Football
I enjoy football because of how **exciting**, **intricate** and **strategic** the sport is. The pace of play is quick and exciting, with enough breaks in play that it doesn't become overwhelming. New rules and novel strategies are continuously introduced to the sport, making the gameplay hard to predict and ever-changing.
